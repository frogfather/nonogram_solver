# nonogram_solver

Final project

Solver for Nonogram logic puzzles

MVP
Solve puzzles up to (eg) 25 x 25
Save and retrieve partially completed puzzles
allow users to control how much of the puzzle is solved (use as aid rather than complete solver)

Extensions
OCR of images of existing puzzles to avoid having to type them in manually (poss too difficult)
Colour puzzles
Generate new puzzles from images

Challenges
Algorithms to solve can be complicated/messy. No single algorithm can solve all puzzles
